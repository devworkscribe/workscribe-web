            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 20, 2026</p>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>WorkScribe ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains
                how our application functions regarding your personal data. <strong>The core philosophy of WorkScribe is
                    "Local First".</strong> We designed the app so that your data remains on your device and is not
                collected, sold, or transmitted to us.</p>

            <h2>2. Data Collection & Usage</h2>
            <p><strong>We do not collect any personal data.</strong></p>
            <p>All entries, images, project details, and statistics created within the app are stored locally on your
                device's internal storage in a secure database. We do not operate a cloud server, and we have no access
                to your information.</p>

            <h2>3. App Permissions</h2>
            <p>WorkScribe requests the following permissions for the sole purpose of providing app functionality:</p>

            <div style="margin-left: 1rem;">
                <h3>📍 Location (Optional)</h3>
                <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Used to attach a geotag (latitude/longitude) to a work entry.</p>
                <p><strong>Usage:</strong> The app only accesses location when you tap the "Add Location" button. This
                    data is saved locally with your entry and is displayed on a map using the Google Maps SDK.</p>

                <h3>📸 Storage & Photos</h3>
                <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Required to attach images to your entries and to save Backup files.</p>
                <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Images you select are copied to the app's local private storage. Backups are
                    written to your device's storage so you can keep them safe.</p>

                <h3>🔒 Biometrics</h3>
                <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Used for the "App Lock" feature.</p>
                <p><strong>Usage:</strong> The app uses the Android Biometric API to authenticate you. Fingerprint/Face
                    data is processed entirely by the Android Operating System; WorkScribe merely receives a "Success"
                    or "Fail" signal.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>4. Third-Party Services & Data Collection</h2>
            <p>While WorkScribe itself does not collect your data, the app utilizes services provided by **Google**
                which may collect information independently when you interact with them.</p>

            <div style="margin-left: 1rem;">
                <h3>Google Maps SDK</h3>
                <p>We use the Google Maps SDK to allow you to view your location-tagged entries on a map.</p>
                <p><strong>What is collected?</strong> When you view the map, your device connects directly to Google's
                    servers. Google may collect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technical Information:</strong> IP address, device identifiers, and operating system
                        version.</li>
                    <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Exact location data is processed by Google to render the map
                        tiles relevant to your position.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interaction Data:</strong> Search queries or map interactions (zooming/panning).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This collection is governed entirely by Google's Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review their
                    terms here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
            </div>

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>No Other Analytics:</strong> Apart from the map functionality described
                above, we <strong>do not</strong> include any other third-party analytics (like Firebase Analytics,
                Facebook SDK, or Mixpanel) or crash reporting tools. Your journal entries and notes are never
                transmitted to third parties.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Safety & Retention</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Since data is stored locally, it is retained indefinitely on your device
                    until you delete the app or clear its data.</li>
                <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete individual entries or all app data via your device
                    settings. Uninstalling the app permanently removes all data associated with it.</li>
                <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Data is stored in the app's private directory, which is
                    sandbox-protected by the Android OS and inaccessible to other apps.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally
                identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. Since our app does not collect data, we do not
                hold data on children.</p>

            <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
                this page.</p>
