            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>WorkScribe ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains
                how our application functions regarding your personal data. <strong>The core philosophy of WorkScribe is
                    "Local First".</strong> We designed the app so that your data remains on your device and is not
                collected or transmitted to us by default.</p>

            <h2>2. Data Collection & Usage</h2>
            <p><strong>We do not collect any personal data on our own servers.</strong></p>
            <p>All entries, images, project details, tasks, and statistics created within the app are stored locally on
                your
                device. If you choose to enable Hybrid Backup or Sync, your data is stored securely in your own private
                Google Drive account.</p>

            <h2>3. App Permissions & Features</h2>
            <p>WorkScribe requests the following permissions to provide app functionality:</p>

            <div style="margin-left: 1rem;">
                <h3>📍 Location (Optional)</h3>
                <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Used to attach a geotag to a work entry.</p>
                <p><strong>Usage:</strong> The app only accesses location when you choose to "Add Location". This
                    data is saved locally and is displayed on a map using the Google Maps SDK.</p>

                <h3>📸 Storage & Media</h3>
                <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Required to attach images to your entries and to synchronize media with
                    your cloud backup.</p>
                <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Images you select are stored locally and encrypted in transit during
                    synchronization to your Google Drive.</p>

                <h3>🔒 Biometrics</h3>
                <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Used for the "App Lock" feature.</p>
                <p><strong>Usage:</strong> The app uses the Android Biometric API for secure local authentication.</p>

                <h3>⏰ Exact Alarms</h3>
                <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Required for Task reminders and notifications.</p>
                <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Used to trigger notifications for your scheduled tasks at the precise time
                    requested.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>While WorkScribe itself does not collect your data, the app utilizes services provided by **Google**
                which may collect information independently when you interact with them.</p>

            <div style="margin-left: 1rem;">
                <h3>Google Drive & Sign-In</h3>
                <p>We use Google Sign-In and the Drive API for the mandatory backup and optional sync features.</p>
                <p><strong>What is shared?</strong> Your email address is used for authentication. Your journal data is
                    stored in a hidden, app-specific folder in your private Google Drive which we cannot access without
                    your active session.</p>

                <h3>Google Maps SDK</h3>
                <p>Usage is governed by the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
                    Google may collect IP addresses and interaction data to render map tiles.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>5. Project Collaboration & Content Sharing</h2>
            <p>When using the Project Collaboration feature, you may invite other users to join a project. In this mode,
                the text and images within that project are shared with the invited participants. You maintain control
                over who has access and can revoke invitations at any time.</p>

            <h2>6. Data Safety, Retention & Deletion</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Local data is retained until you delete the app. Cloud data is retained
                    in your Google Drive until you choose to delete it.</li>
                <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All data transmitted for backup or sync is encrypted in transit.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Deletion (Right to be Forgotten):</strong>
                    <p>Users have full control over their data deletion. To delete all data:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Delete individual entries or projects within the app.</li>
                        <li>Uninstall the app to remove all local data.</li>
                        <li>Delete the "WorkScribe" folder from your Google Drive account.</li>
                        <li>You can request explicit data deletion or account disconnection at <a
                                href="https://devworkscribe.github.io/workscribe-web/privacy.html">this page</a> or by
                            contacting us via email.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
